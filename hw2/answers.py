# Part 6 (YOLO) answers


part6_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**
1. The model performance was not good, in the first image it detected a surfboard which doesn't exist in the image and misclsified the two dolphines as persons.
In the second image we can say that the performance was slightly better but still not good enough. 
In terms of segmentation it performed poorly on the cat+dog in the left side of the image(which were segmented as the same object), but the classification was poor
it misclassified two of the dogs as cats (one of them is segmented with the cat but the dog still takes most of the bounding box). 
2. In the first image, we can see that the model doesn't cotain a "dolphin" class, therefore it classified the dolphins as persons.
In the second image, the objects in the image have a high overlap and are located very close to each other. Therefore, the model had a hard time to classify and segment the objects.

part6_q3 = r"""
**Your answer:**
1. In the first image (donuts) we can see that the model detected 3 donuts out of 5 possible, and it may be because the bluriness of the image, and the fact that the two other donuts are cropped.
<br> In the second image we can see that the model did not detect the person in the image, and it may be because of the poor lighting in the image.
<br> In the third image we can see that out of many possible forks, spoons and knives, the model detected only a single spoon, which demonstrating the affect of clutterness on the model performance.
